# Gym-Tracker

I built this app as a personal project to practice mobile development. I used **Expo Go** to get exposure to React Native while still benefiting from helpful tooling that makes the learning experience a bit more frictionless.  
This wasn’t my first app, but it is the first one I intentionally designed and built from the start to be something I’d actually use in my daily life.

## Purpose of the app

One of my passions is training at the gym, and to track my progress and keep improving I used to log all my sets in my notes app.  
This worked well for the past 3 years, but it was never ideal. I’d start by copying and pasting the previous workout, then adjusting the weights for each set. I ended up with a lot of exercises with strikethrough formatting just so I could keep them visible without deleting them. Over time, the notes became messy and hard to manage.

The idea of this app was to design it exactly around how I like to train and track my workouts. I progressively overload my sets, which means I need to know what I did in previous workouts for each exercise as well as my **personal record (PR)**. This was a core requirement, along with many smaller but important details.

## Outcome

The app is now at a stage where I use it for **all** of my workouts. In the early stages I tested it myself and noticed several annoyances that could be improved. One major one was the ability to **duplicate sets** or **duplicate all the sets from a previous workout’s exercise instance**, which saves me a significant amount of time.

If you’d like a copy of the **Android APK**, feel free to reach out. I haven’t bundled it for iOS yet, as I don’t own an Apple mobile device, but I can if needed. I’ve tested it on iOS emulators on my Mac, and the functionality should work as expected.
